# Guessing-Game
To play the game, clone this repo and run `gradle run`.

## Instructions
The game will randomly choose a word for you to guess, and you have to try to guess the word by clicking on any letter. You start with 5 lives, and for every incorrect letter, you lose 1 life. You win if you guess the word before running out of lives, and you lose if you lose all lives.
